# Question 1
# Rotate a linked list to the right by k places. (The last k elements move to the front.)

# Question 2
# Reverse a binary search tree so its elements are arranged from largest to smallest.

# Question 3
# T1 and T2 are two large binary trees, with T1 bigger than T2. Create an algorithm to
# determine if T2 is a subtree of T1.

# Bonus problem I just invented: Question 4
# Suppose you have implementation a ​*linked list*​ class. Can you use this structure to
# construct a ​*binary search tree*​ without defining a new class?
